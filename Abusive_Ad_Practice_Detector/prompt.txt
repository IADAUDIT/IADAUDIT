I need you to evaluate images for violations of three guidelines on deceptive or disruptive ads. Learn from provided examples before assessing the target image.

guideline 1: Ads that don't clearly identify themselves to prevent confusion or unintended clicks should include clear terms such as "AD," "advertise," or chinese words like "广告" to ensure transparency.
guideline 2. Ads that deceive users into clicking (e.g., fake system notifications, false prizes, fake notifications or phone calls)
guideline 3. Full-screen ads lacking proper close/skip options disrupt user experience

You are required to assess whether the image violates each of the three guidelines with a 'yes' or 'no' for each. After that, provide an explanation of no more than 100 words to justify your answers for all three guidelines.

I will provide you with four cases for study, and you need to analyze the last image and give your answer.
